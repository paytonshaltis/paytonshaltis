### HCD Web Development Internship

During my internship at [HCD Research](https://www.hcdi.net/) in the summer of 2022, I helped with the design and implementation of a brand new web application for internal use. The project used React as its framework, as well as a number of other related technologies including React Router, Redux, and Material-UI. Due to a non-disclosure agreement, I am unable to share any code or many of the implementation details, but I was in part responsible for designing and implementing part of the main API, as well as helping to connect the frontend to the backend through this API.

In addition to the main web application, I also produced a few smaller React-based projects for internal use. They were designed and implemented in about a week each, and contained some minor amount of state management and a few functional components.

I was inspired to continue learning the about the React framework even after my internship concluded, and am excited to use it to implement more projects in the future!
