## Projects that use C:

### ðŸ•¸ Web Development

- **[TCNJ Library App]()** - A full-stack web and mobile application for tracking live study-room occupancy data. Created over the course of more than 10 years by several TCNJ CS majors. See the repository for my personal contributions to the project over a 2-semester research experience.

### ðŸ”  Programming Languages

- **[B-Minor](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/b-minor)** - A simple C-like language implemented over the course of a semester for CSC-425: Compilers and Interpreters. Includes a lexical analyzer, parser, and machine code generator for ARM-based processors, all written from scratch.
