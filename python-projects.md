## Projects that use Python:

<br>

### üï∏ Web Development

- **[TCNJ Library App]()** - A full-stack web and mobile application for tracking live study-room occupancy data. Created over the course of more than 10 years by several TCNJ CS majors. See the repository for my personal contributions to the project over a 2-semester research experience.

### üëÅ Computer Vision

- **[Tello Follow]()** - A program for controlling a DJI Tello drone via facial recognition and object detection based on HCI principles like color masking and object tracking.
- **[Head Nod Detection]()** - A facial recognition system that determines if a user is currently nodding yes, no, or remaining still. Uses a number of points of interest and a custom algorithm in order to determine if movements should actually be considered as nods.
- **[Arm Raise Detection]()** - A pose detection system that determines which of the user's arms are currently raised or lowered. Utilizes a simple algorithm for determining the current pose of both arms.

### ü§ñ Automation

- **[Amazon Bias Correction]()** - A web scraper for detecting and correcting Amazon product review bias. Uses a custom algorithm for determining if a review is biased, and implements a strategy for correcting it.

### üî† Programming Languages

- **[B-Minor]()** - A simple C-like language implemented over the course of a semester for CSC-425: Compilers and Interpreters. Includes a lexical analyzer, parser, and machine code generator for ARM-based processors, all written from scratch.
