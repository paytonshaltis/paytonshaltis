## 💻 Projects

I like working on a variety of projects in different areas of Computer Science, but my main areas of interest are Web Development, Computer Vision, and Automation. Here are some of my favorite projects that I've worked on over the last several years. Feel free to click on a project's name to visit the GitHub repository for it, where you can learn more about the languages used, the features implemented, and the technologies used to build it!

### 🕸 Web Development

- **[ACCR Mail Manager]()** - A full-stack web app for managing inmate paper mail used internally by [ACCR](https://www.atlanticcenter.org/) (The Atlantic Center for Capital Representation). This semester-long group project was developed for CSC-415: Software Engineering, and required multiple iterations of design, requirements gathering with an actual client, implementation, presentation, testing, and delivery.
- **[TCNJ Library App]()** - A full-stack web and mobile application for tracking live study-room occupancy data. Created over the course of more than 10 years by several TCNJ CS majors. See the repository for my personal contributions to the project over a 2-semester research experience.
- **[The GOON Card]()** - A full-stack web app for creating and sharing dynamically-generated business cards. Choose exactly _which_ social media links to share on a person-by-person basis on the fly in order to organize personal and professional contacts. Created as collaborative final project for CSC-355: Human Computer Interaction.
- **[Pantry Packer]()** - A full-stack web app that tailors donations for food pantries based on their current needs. A pantry can request donations of specific items, and donors can search for pantries to donate to based on these needs and their location.
- **[Wordle Guesser]()** - A simple web app that helps suggest words for the popular word game Wordle. Implements a custom algorithm for determining the next best word to guess based on the current state of the game.
- **[Personal Website]()** - A simple personal website used for hosting my resume, contact links, and other minor information about me.
- **[Freighter]()** - A flexible library for creating dynamic abd customizable HTML carousels. Also features a complete documentation website with demos, API docs, and downloads page.

### 👁 Computer Vision

- **[Tello Follow]()** - A program for controlling a DJI Tello drone via facial recognition and object detection based on HCI principles like color masking and object tracking.
- **[Head Nod Detection]()** - A facial recognition system that determines if a user is currently nodding yes, no, or remaining still. Uses a number of points of interest and a custom algorithm in order to determine if movements should actually be considered as nods.
- **[Arm Raise Detection]()** - A pose detection system that determines which of the user's arms are currently raised or lowered. Utilizes a simple algorithm for determining the current pose of both arms.

### 🤖 Automation

- **[Amazon Bias Correction]()** - A web scraper for detecting and correcting Amazon product review bias. Uses a custom algorithm for determining if a review is biased, and implements a strategy for correcting it.
- **[Easy Enroll]()** - A script written to automatically prioritize college course registration based on a number of factors including student major, course prerequisites, and course availability.

### 🔠 Programming Languages

- **[B-Minor]()** - A simple C-like language implemented over the course of a semester for CSC-425: Compilers and Interpreters. Includes a lexical analyzer, parser, and machine code generator for ARM-based processors, all written from scratch.
