- **[ACCR Mail Manager]()** - A full-stack web app for managing inmate paper mail used internally by [ACCR](https://www.atlanticcenter.org/) (The Atlantic Center for Capital Representation). This semester-long group project was developed for CSC-415: Software Engineering, and required multiple iterations of design, requirements gathering with an actual client, implementation, presentation, testing, and delivery.
- **[Pantry Packer]()** - A full-stack web app that tailors donations for food pantries based on their current needs. A pantry can request donations of specific items, and donors can search for pantries to donate to based on these needs and their location.
