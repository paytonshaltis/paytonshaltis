## Projects that use Git / GitHub:

### üï∏ Web Development

- **[ACCR Mail Manager]()** - A full-stack web app for managing inmate paper mail used internally by [ACCR](https://www.atlanticcenter.org/) (The Atlantic Center for Capital Representation). This semester-long group project was developed for CSC-415: Software Engineering, and required multiple iterations of design, requirements gathering with an actual client, implementation, presentation, testing, and delivery.
- **[TCNJ Library App]()** - A full-stack web and mobile application for tracking live study-room occupancy data. Created over the course of more than 10 years by several TCNJ CS majors. See the repository for my personal contributions to the project over a 2-semester research experience.
- **[The GOON Card](https://github.com/sderacy/gooncard)** - A full-stack web app for creating and sharing dynamically-generated business cards. Choose exactly _which_ social media links to share on a person-by-person basis on the fly in order to organize personal and professional contacts. Created as collaborative final project for CSC-355: Human Computer Interaction.
- **[Pantry Packer](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/pantry-packer)** - A full-stack web app that tailors donations for food pantries based on their current needs. A pantry can request donations of specific items, and donors can search for pantries to donate to based on these needs.
- **[Wordle Guesser](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/wordle-guesser)** - A simple web app that helps suggest words for the popular word game Wordle. Implements a custom algorithm for determining the next best word to guess based on the current state of the game.
- **[Personal Website](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/personal-site)** - A simple personal website used for hosting my resume, contact links, and other minor information about me.
- **[Freighter](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/freighter)** - A flexible library for creating dynamic abd customizable HTML carousels. Also features a complete documentation website with demos, API docs, and downloads page.

### üëÅ Computer Vision

- **[Tello Follow](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/tello-follow)** - A program for controlling a DJI Tello drone via facial recognition and object detection based on HCI principles like color masking and object tracking.
- **[Head Nod Detection](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/head-nod-detection)** - A facial recognition system that determines if a user is currently nodding yes, no, or remaining still. Uses a number of points of interest and a custom algorithm in order to determine if movements should actually be considered as nods.
- **[Arm Raise Detection](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/arm-raise-detection)** - A pose detection system that determines which of the user's arms are currently raised or lowered. Utilizes a simple algorithm for determining the current pose of both arms.

### ü§ñ Automation

- **[Amazon Bias Correction](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/amazon-bias-correction)** - A web scraper for detecting and correcting Amazon product review bias. Uses a custom algorithm for determining if a review is biased, and implements a strategy for correcting it.
- **[Easy Enroll](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/easy-enroll)** - A script written to automatically prioritize college course registration based on a number of factors including student major, course prerequisites, and course availability.

### üî† Programming Languages

- **[B-Minor](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/b-minor)** - A simple C-like language implemented over the course of a semester for CSC-425: Compilers and Interpreters. Includes a lexical analyzer, parser, and machine code generator for ARM-based processors, all written from scratch.
