### ðŸ•¸ Web Development

- **[TCNJ Library App]()** - A full-stack web and mobile application for tracking live study-room occupancy data. Created over the course of more than 10 years by several TCNJ CS majors. See the repository for my personal contributions to the project over a 2-semester research experience.
- **[The GOON Card]()** - A full-stack web app for creating and sharing dynamically-generated business cards. Choose exactly _which_ social media links to share on a person-by-person basis on the fly in order to organize personal and professional contacts. Created as collaborative final project for CSC-355: Human Computer Interaction.
